# What is the Public Developer Preview for Microsoft Teams?

Public Developer Preview is a program for developers that provides early access to unreleased features. Features included in preview may not be complete and may undergo changes before becoming available in the public release.

## How do I get access?

To participate in the Public Developer Preview, you need to do the following:

1. Turn on the setting for enabling uploading of apps in the admin console of your tenant as described in [Prepare your Office 365 tenant](~/get-started/get-started-tenant).

2. The Teams client shows a menu item for switching to the preview under Menu → About.

Note that features available to you in preview mode might result in messages that don't render correctly for other people who might be using a public version of the Teams client.

## How do I turn it off?

Use the same menu item under Menu → About → Developer preview, and click on it to turn it off.

## What features will I have access to?

See [Features in the Public Developer Preview](~/resources/general/developer-preview-features).
